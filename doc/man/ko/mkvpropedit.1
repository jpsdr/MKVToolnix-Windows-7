This program analyses an existing
Matroska(TM)
file and modifies some of its properties\&. Then it writes those modifications to the existing file\&. Among the properties that can be changed are the segment information elements (e\&.g\&. the title) and the track headers (e\&.g\&. the language code, \*(Aqdefault track\*(Aq flag or the name)\&.
.PP
옵션:
.PP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\-property\-names\fR
.RS 4
Lists all known and editable property names, their type (string, integer, boolean etc) and a short description\&. The program exits afterwards\&. Therefore the
\fIsource\-filename\fR
parameter does not have to be supplied\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-parse\-mode\fR \fImode\fR
.RS 4
Sets the parse mode\&. The parameter \*(Aq\fImode\fR\*(Aq can either be \*(Aqfast\*(Aq (which is also the default) or \*(Aqfull\*(Aq\&. The \*(Aqfast\*(Aq mode does not parse the whole file but uses the meta seek elements for locating the required elements of a source file\&. In 99% of all cases this is enough\&. But for files that do not contain meta seek elements or which are damaged the user might have to set the \*(Aqfull\*(Aq parse mode\&. A full scan of a file can take a couple of minutes while a fast scan only takes seconds\&.
.RE
.PP
Actions that deal with track and segment info properties:
.PP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-edit\fR \fIselector\fR
.RS 4
Sets the
Matroska(TM)
file section (segment information or a certain track\*(Aqs headers) that all following
add,
set

delete
actions operate on\&. This option can be used multiple times in order to make modifications to more than one element\&.
.sp
By default
\fBmkvpropedit\fR(1)
will edit the segment information section\&.
.sp
See the section about
edit selectors
for a full description of the syntax\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-add\fR \fIname\fR=\fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Adds a property
\fIname\fR

\fIvalue\fR\&. The property will be added even if such a property exists already\&. Note that most properties are unique and cannot occur more than once\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-set\fR \fIname\fR=\fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Sets all occurrences of the property

\fIvalue\fR\&. If no such property exists then it will be added\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-delete\fR \fIname\fR

Actions that deal with tags and chapters:
.PP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-tags\fR \fIselector\fR:\fIfilename\fR
.RS 4
Add or replace tags in the file with the ones from

\fBmkvpropedit\fR(1)
reads the same XML tag format that

\fBall\fR,
\fBglobal\fR

\fBtrack\fR\&. For
\fBall\fR
\fBmkvpropedit\fR(1)
will replace or remove all tags in a file\&. With
\fBglobal\fR
only global tags will be replaced or removed\&.
.sp
With
\fBtrack\fR
\fBmkvpropedit\fR(1)
will replace tags for a specific track\&. Additionally the tags read from
filename
will be assigned to the same track\&. The track is specified in the same way
edit selectors
are specified (see below), e\&.g\&.
\-\-tags track:a1:new\-audio\-tags\&.xml\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-add\-track\-statistics\-tags\fR
.RS 4
Calculates statistics for all tracks in a file and adds new statistics tags for them\&. If the file already contains such tags then they\*(Aqll be updated\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-delete\-track\-statistics\-tags\fR
.RS 4
Deletes all existing track statistics tags from a file\&. If the file doesn\*(Aqt contain track statistics tags then it won\*(Aqt be modified\&.
.RE

\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-chapters\fR \fIfilename\fR
